    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute in relation to the size of the input. In the realm of algorithmic efficiency, time complexity serves as a yardstick to measure how well an algorithm performs, particularly as the input size grows. An algorithm with lower time complexity is deemed more efficient, as it exhibits a faster execution time, making it a preferred choice in the design and implementation of computational solutions. As developers strive for optimal performance, a clear understanding of time complexity is paramount in crafting algorithms that strike a balance between functionality and efficiency.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, and it is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input data. Managing Space Complexity efficiently is crucial for optimizing algorithms and ensuring they use memory resources effectively.</p>
