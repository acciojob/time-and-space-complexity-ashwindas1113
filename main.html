    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science and algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute in relation to the size of the input. In the realm of algorithmic efficiency, time complexity serves as a yardstick to measure how well an algorithm performs, particularly as the input size grows. An algorithm with lower time complexity is deemed more efficient, as it exhibits a faster execution time, making it a preferred choice in the design and implementation of computational solutions. As developers strive for optimal performance, a clear understanding of time complexity is paramount in crafting algorithms that strike a balance between functionality and efficiency.</p>
    <p>In the realm of algorithm analysis, understanding space complexity is pivotal for crafting efficient solutions that optimize memory usage. Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires for execution, and it is expressed in terms of Big O notation, denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. This notation provides a scalable measure, indicating how the algorithm's space requirements grow concerning the input size. Achieving a low space complexity, preferably O(n) or even O(1), is often a key goal for developers. Algorithms with lower <b>Space complexity</b> not only contribute to efficient memory usage but also ensure that the program can handle larger inputs without causing excessive strain on the system. Balancing space complexity alongside time complexity is a fundamental aspect of designing algorithms that excel in both computational efficiency and resource management.</p>
